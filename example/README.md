# Moped Chat

![demo image](http://i.imgur.com/Hhnp3gP.gif)

To run this demo, just clone the moped repo and run `npm install` to install dependencies followed by `node example/server` then load http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

To get started reading the code, begin in ./server.js, which loads the moped application in ./app.js, which in turn uses the react components found in ./components to create a fully functioning real time chat room application.
